Note that we cannot push a file without read permissions to the git repository.
You will have to create your own if you want one. The simplest approach is to
enter the following commands:

	touch test6.args; chmod u-r test6.args

Note that the versions of my_factorial for Q4 will attempt to convert each
command-line argument to an integer value, calculate the factorial value, and
output it. If the value isn't a valid integer, the program terminates with a
non-zero return value. If there were no command-line arguments, the program
returns a non-zero value. If it managed to successfully process each argument,
a zero value is returned.

You may also wish to test an executable file that does not have executable
permissions, you can also do this by using any file that does not have its
executable bits set as one of the executable arguments.
