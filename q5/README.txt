Note that we cannot push a file without read permissions to the git repository.
You will have to create your own if you want one. The simplest approach is to
enter the following commands:

	touch test1.in; chmod u-r test1.in

Note that the versions of my_factorial for Q5 will attempt to convert each
command-line argument to an integer value, calculate the factorial value, and
output it. If the value isn't a valid integer, the program terminates with a
non-zero return value. 

If there were no command-line arguments, the program attempts to read in an
integer from stdin. If the read fails, the program returns a non-zero value.
Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the factorial value.

If it managed to successfully process each command-line argument, or the value
read from stdin, a zero value is returned.
